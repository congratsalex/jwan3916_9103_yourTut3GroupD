## Part 1
### In Minecraft, the game's world is made up of pixel blocks, each with its own unique texture and color. I wanted to use p5.js in my project to simulate this pixel art and block rendering effect, creating a simple and abstract visual style.

#### Part2 : Coding technique Exploration
##### Coding technique:
###### Use p5.js to simulate and render pixel art and block effects.
###### Technical Discussion:
###### My code creates a campfire-like effect where each "flame square" has a different color, size, and location. Using ‘lerpColor’, ‘random’, and ‘FireSquare’ functions, the rendering effect of blocks in Minecraft is simulated.
